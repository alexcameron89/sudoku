## Rust Sudoku Builder

This project was built with the following rules:
 - Build it with what I knew in Rust vs. trying to use all of the Rust features I don't
 - Make it work(Don't over optimize early), make it right(Make the code easy to understand), make it fast(Optimize) Stolen from Sandi & Katrina)
 - Learn new things in Rust and implement them here
 
With these rules, I've been able to build something and continue moving forward without trying to make it perfect. Doing so gives me immediate context when I learn something new about rust,
giving me a project to go practice with.
